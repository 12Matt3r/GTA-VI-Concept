# 🎮 Control Systems & Player Agency

## Dual Control System Overview

ChromaShift supports two complementary ways to interact:

1. Structured Control (Choice Bubbles)
2. Generative Control (Command Interface)

Players may freely mix both.

---

## Structured Control: Speech Bubbles

- Always show 4 free-exploration choices; optionally a 5th mission/whisper choice.
- Bubbles are positioned in 3D around the panoramic view.
- Visual language:
  - Exploration: Purple border, soft glow.
  - Mission: Gold border, pulsing glow.

When a bubble is selected:

- Trigger reality blink + eye blink transitions.
- Update scene title, description, WTF ticker, stats, and choices.
- Potentially advance or resolve a whisper.

## Generative Control: Command Interface

Two textual command channels:

1. Shift Destination  
   - Input: Any location or concept.
   - Effect: Teleport to surreal reinterpretation of that location.
2. Manifestation Command  
   - Input: Any action phrased in natural language.
   - Effect: Contextual, surreal outcome inside the current scene.

The engine must:

- Parse verbs and key nouns.
- Classify into action/location types (touch, consume, speak, abstract, etc.).
- Apply surrealist logic to generate outcomes (visual + systemic changes).

## Hybrid Play

- Bubbles give curated experiences and easier onboarding.
- Commands unlock full creative agency.
- Both affect the same underlying dream state and progression systems.
