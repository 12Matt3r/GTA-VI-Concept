# 🧠 Core Game & Lore Architecture

## Setting & Aesthetic

- Modern urban environments and familiar domestic spaces, viewed through distorted dream logic.
- Recurring motifs: melting objects, liquid floors, impossible architecture, non-Euclidean geometry, synesthetic textures.
- Bright, overexposed hyper-realism that feels “too real to be real.”

## Emotional & Thematic Axes

Each scene or arc can be tinted by a theme:

- Guilt, nostalgia, ambition, apathy, fear, or integration.
- Themes drive visual cues, NPC behavior, and environmental symbolism.

## Dream Tiers

Dream Tier (1–5) indicates depth of immersion:

- Higher tiers: More surreal visuals, lower coherence, more powerful actions.
- Tier shifts are triggered by completing “whispers” (optional mission-like objectives).

## Narrative Philosophy

- No fixed main story; instead, a mesh of vignettes.
- Whispers provide optional structure without forcing linear progress.
- The world remembers: objects, locations, and NPCs can reflect prior scenes.

## Key Lore Devices

- The Blink: Brief flashes of real-world images between scenes.
- The Unmasked Wall: Visible raw code or wireframe area in many scenes.
- Shifting Signage: Text that morphs meaning when observed.
- Memory Fragments: Collectible glimpses of the protagonist’s real life.
