## Lore: Why Can You Do This?

You are a **Chromatist**—someone who has achieved lucid awareness within the Chroma-Dream. This grants you the power to manipulate reality through language. The command interface is your **direct connection to the dream's source code**.

## Tips for Maximum Surrealism

### Location Shifting:
✅ **Be creative:** "The library where books read you"  
✅ **Be abstract:** "The space between thoughts"  
✅ **Be nostalgic:** "The playground I visited as a child"  
✅ **Be impossible:** "Inside my own eye"

❌ **Don't worry about being "correct"** - all inputs are valid!

### Action Manifestation:
✅ **Be specific:** "Lick the melting trophy"  
✅ **Be absurd:** "Challenge the floor to a debate"  
✅ **Be emotional:** "Cry into the void and see what cries back"  
✅ **Be experimental:** "Try to touch yesterday"

❌ **No action is too weird** - the dream adapts to everything!

## What the Dream Does With Your Input

The generative AI interprets your commands through **surrealist dream logic**:

- **"Go to the beach"** → Ocean made of liquid memories where waves bring forgotten moments
- **"Touch the wall"** → Wall inverts your sense of touch and feels YOU instead
- **"Speak my name"** → Words crystallize in air and gain sentience
- **"Fly"** → Gravity becomes negotiable, physics optional

Every input creates a **unique, contextual response** based on:
- The words you use
- Your current location
- Your dream state (lucidity, coherence)
- The surrealist interpretation engine

---

## Stats Impact

Your commands affect your dream state:

### Lucidity (🧠)
- How aware you are that you're dreaming
- Increases: Vision actions, abstract concepts, space exploration
- Decreases: Touch actions, consumption, familiar locations

### Reality Coherence (⚠️)
- How stable/unstable the dream is
- Decreases with most actions (chaos increases)
- Affects progression and descent mechanics

### Perception (👁️)
- Your current state of awareness
- Can become: DISTORTED, MULTIVERSAL, COSMIC AWARENESS, META-AWARE, etc.

## Philosophy

> **"Everything is valid. Everything generates a response. You are the dreamer and the dream."**

The generative system has no restrictions because **dreams have no restrictions**. Whatever you imagine, the system will interpret through its surrealist lens and create a unique experience.

There are no:
- ❌ Wrong commands
- ❌ Invalid locations
- ❌ Forbidden actions
- ❌ Error messages (except empty input reminders)

Only:
- ✅ Infinite possibilities
- ✅ Surreal interpretations
- ✅ Emergent narratives
- ✅ Total creative freedom
