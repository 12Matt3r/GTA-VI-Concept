## XI. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY & CREATIVE INTENT

### Core Principles

**1. Agency Over Structure**
- Player freedom supersedes narrative arc
- All inputs are valid
- Chaos is feature, not bug

**2. Surrealism Over Realism**
- Logic is advisory
- Impossible is expected
- Meaning emerges from absurdity

**3. Beauty in Wrongness**
- Uncanny valley is home
- Discomfort creates engagement
- Wrong feels right here

**4. Language as Reality**
- Words reshape environment
- Commands are spells
- Speaking manifests truth

**5. Dream as Collaboration**
- AI interprets, player creates
- Emergent narrative
- No two playthroughs identical

### Inspirations

- **Surrealist Art:** Melting clocks, elongated forms, impossible physics
- **David Lynch:** Uncanny normality, dream logic, red rooms
- **M.C. Escher:** Recursive geometry, impossible spaces
- **Jorge Luis Borges:** Infinite libraries, labyrinths, meta-fiction
- **Inception:** Dream layers, reality questioning, architecture
- **The Matrix:** Code beneath surface, red pill/blue pill choice
- **Yume Nikki:** Surreal exploration, symbolic environments

### Emotional Targets

Players should feel:
- **Wonder** (impossible beauty)
- **Unease** (uncanny wrongness)
- **Power** (reality manipulation)
- **Confusion** (logic breakdown)
- **Recognition** (symbolic meaning)
- **Freedom** (unlimited choice)
- **Consequence** (actions matter)
