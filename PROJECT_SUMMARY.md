👑 CHROMA SHIFT: FINAL COMPETITION SUMMARY (V2.0)
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW & CONCEPT
Title: ChrømaShift: The Psychedelic Quest for the Chroma Award
 * Game Type: Anti-Linear Generative AI Experience / Guided Psychedelic Quest.
 * Aesthetic: Hyper-Realism Meets Surrealism; utilizing melting objects, impossible geometry, and a high-brightness, psychedelic palette.
 * Narrative Goal: The player must successfully navigate an escalating, continuous storyline to collect Chroma-Keys and win the final Chroma Award, the validation of their consciousness.
 * Starting Point (CRITICAL): The experience begins in the player's Living Room where the static from a CRT Television acts as the dream portal.
2. CORE TECHNICAL SEQUENCE & INNOVATION
The entire experience is driven by a compulsory, highly-timed Multimodal Transition Sequence:
 * Initial Launch: The game starts with the CRT Glitch Prolog (visualizing the 20-second Protocol Failure countdown) while the theme music begins playing.
 * Image Generation: Every player action forces the AI to generate a new, unique 360° panoramic image based on the story's progression.
 * Audio Integration (TTS Fix): TTS audio reads only the narrative text over the glitching transition visual.
 * UI/Interaction: The choice bubbles are semi-transparent and dynamically mapped to contextually relevant objects within the 360° panoramic scene.
 * Narrative Control: The continuous story is enforced by ReAct Logic (Reasoning and Acting) that uses the player’s input to reveal the next necessary plot point.
